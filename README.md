Provides mutation coverage for your Java programs within the Eclipse IDE. Built on [PIT (Pitest)](http://pitest.org) for reliability.

## What is mutation testing?

> Faults (or mutations) are automatically seeded into your code, then your tests are run. If your tests fail then the mutation is killed, if your tests pass then the mutation lived.
>
> The quality of your tests can be gauged from the percentage of mutations killed.
>
> *Henry Coles, [pitest.org](https://pitest.org)*

## Main Features

- **Reliability**: uses [PIT (Pitest)](http://pitest.org) to compute
- **Customization**: provides numerous preferences to tailor analysis
- **JUnit support**: works with both JUnit 4 and JUnit 5 tests

## Usage

First of all, you need to install Pitclipse in your Eclipse IDE (see [Installation](Installation) below).

Once the plug-in is installed, you can run Pitest:
- Right-click on a Java project defining unit tests
- `Run As` > `PIT Mutation Test`

Wait a few seconds, two views should open to show the results:
- **PIT Summary**: shows the percentage of mutation coverage
- **PIT Mutations**: shows the detected mutations and their location in code

It is also possible to run a single JUnit test class. Specific PIT options can be configured from the Launch Configuration window:
- `Run` > `Run Configurations...`
- Double-click on `PIT Mutation Test`
- Specify the options
- Press `Run`

Preferences also allow to change mutation settings (`Window > Preferences > Pitest`).

## Installation

The plug-in is available in the [Eclipse Marketplace](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/pitclipse).

Drag the following button to your running Eclipse workspace to start the installation:
